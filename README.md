# Nothing-portfolio 

A minimalist personal portfolio website inspired by **Nothing OS** aesthetics — clean UI, monochrome palette, subtle grid, and glyph-style interactions.
This project is built to showcase my learning journey in **Quality Assurance (QA)** and **Prompt Engineering**, along with web fundamentals.
